# Reading list

## The deep learning textbook

[_Goodfellow, Ian. et al., (2016). Deep Learning. MIT press._](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)

This is the reference book for this part of the module The module will assume prior knowledge of basic machine learning, covered in Part I of the book. The lectures will go through the majoirty of Part II and selective topics in Part III, with an introduction to latest research topics in the fiels and applications in medical imaging.

## Basic machine learning textbooks
[_Hastie et al., The Elements of Statistical Learning. Springer_](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf) 

It is used in the first part of the module. 

[_Bishop, C.M., (2006). Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning. Springer_](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf)

For the basic machine learning referecnce, with consistent mathematical notations to the _Deep Learning_ book.
