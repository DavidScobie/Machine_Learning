This totualrial demonstrates an algorithm of ultrasound image simulation using generative adversarial networks (GANs), using a simplified data set used [a published paper](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1707/1707.05392.pdf).

The [deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGAN)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf) is implemented in TensorFlow and PyTorch.
