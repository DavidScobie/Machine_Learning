This tutorial implements unsupervised image registration networks for 2D head-and-neck CT images  


## TensorFlow 2  
The tutorial uses code adapted from [Tensorflow Examples](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples), please install first in the `mphy0041` conda environment:
```
pip install -q git+https://github.com/tensorflow/examples.git
```
